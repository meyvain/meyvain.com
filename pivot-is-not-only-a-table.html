    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>We were tasked with conducting a large-scale (some might even argue pushing qualitative into quantitative with N=70) discovery project across three different therapeutic areas and three stakeholder groups —all of which to be concluded on an aggressive timeline. The key challenge was not just to execute the research, but to find a clear, actionable signal amidst the noise and to be agile enough to adapt our approach when new insights emerged or the scope was changed by the client (yet again).</p>
<p>(And to zoom the lens perhaps a touch closer via my private lens, the technical lead on the project had left the team, just as we were about to approach the discovery phase, leaving me as the lead researcher on this project. Although it was certainly a privilege, this was not an easy task for me to take on with immediate effect.)</p>
<h2>The Approach</h2>
<p>We began with a short, immersive one-day ethnography in a London operating theatre. While brief, this early contextual inquiry was critical. It allowed us to ground our assumptions in reality and better anticipate the risks and opportunities, informing how we are to design all subsequent research materials.</p>

<p>We then moved into the stakeholder interviews stage, using the DVF (Desirability, Viability, Feasibility) framework to map the business landscape. This, combined with a co-creation workshop, allowed us to collaborate with our industrial designers to develop storyboards as a visual stimulus— a crucial methodological tool we often use to help us uncover latent, unmet user needs during the main phase of discovery research.</p>

<h2>The Pivot</h2>
<p>After the first few of our 70 planned interviews, I recognised a critical issue: our carefully crafted visual stimulus was unintentionally leading users and creating significant assumptions.</p>
<p>I made the leadership call to pivot. Despite the time and effort already invested by the team, I paused and crafted a simpler, more open-ended user journey framework stimulus. This was a difficult decision mid-fieldwork, but it was a necessary strategic call to protect the integrity of the data. The new stimulus was implemented rapidly, and the improvement in data quality was immediate and significant, a decision the client fully supported.</p>
<h2>Deliverables &amp; Strategic Impact</h2>
<p>The beautiful chaos of our synthesis was ultimately distilled into a highly structured User Needs document, delivered in the client's preferred Excel format. This demonstrates a key part of the work: adapting our outputs to fit seamlessly into the client's internal processes.</p>

<p>The project culminated in a strategy workshop in the US, where I presented our findings and collaborated on the prioritised user needs list to craft different opportunity areas and strategise on the different avenues the team can explore moving forward. For me, this is the core of the craft. It is a humbling and powerful moment to be in a room of decision-makers, sharing insights that people have trusted you with and bringing their voice true. My role is to be the bridge—to bring the unfiltered voice of the user directly to those who will design their next medical device, building the empathy and strategic clarity that is the foundation of all great innovation.</p>
