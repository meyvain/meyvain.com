        <h1>Pivot Is Not Only a Table</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>We were tasked with conducting a large-scale (some might even argue pushing qualitative into quantitative with N=70 In-Depth Interviews) discovery project across three different therapeutic areas and three user groups, all of which had to be concluded on an aggressive timeline, for one of the largest global pharmaceutical companies out there, and certainly one of the team's biggest clients. The key challenge was not just to execute the research [crafting the research materials, inc screeners and interview guides, and stakeholder interviews, user interviews, contextual inquiry/ethnographic field work, building storyboards, workflow map, pain points/service frictions mapping, culminating in a report where we would share our insights, with a detailed user needs map and strategic opportunity scoping]. Rather, to find a clear direction, a signal amidst the noise, as the client was under a lot of pressure and was lacking clarity in their ask and communication.</p>
<p>Personally, one of the challenges I faced during this project was introduced when the technical lead on the project left the team, just as we were about to approach the discovery phase, leaving me as the lead researcher on this project. Although a privilege, this was not an easy task, with immediate effect, with a project already on an aggressive timeline.</p>
<h2>The Approach</h2>
<p>We began with a short, immersive one-day contextual inquiry/ethnographic field work in the operating theatre. While brief, this early contextual inquiry was critical. It allowed us to ground our assumptions in reality and better anticipate the risks and opportunities, the workflow with a holistic service view, informing how we are to design all subsequent research materials.</p>

<p>We then moved into the stakeholder interviews stage, using the DVF (Desirability, Viability, Feasibility) framework to map the business landscape. This, combined with a co-creation workshop, allowed us to collaborate with our industrial designers to develop storyboards as a visual stimulus— a crucial methodological tool we often use to help us uncover latent, unmet user needs during the main phase of discovery research.</p>

<h2>The Pivot</h2>
<p>After the first few of our 70 planned user interviews, I recognised a critical issue: our carefully crafted visual storyboard stimulus was unintentionally biasing users and creating significant assumptions.</p>
<p>I made the leadership call to pivot. Despite the time and effort already invested by the team, I paused and crafted a simpler, more open-ended user journey framework stimulus, rather than a fully fleshed-out storyboard. This was a difficult decision mid-fieldwork, but it was a necessary strategic call to protect the integrity of the data. The new low-fidelity workflow stimulus was implemented rapidly, and the improvement in data quality was immediate and significant, a decision the client fully supported.</p>
<h2>Deliverables &amp; Strategic Impact</h2>
<p>The beautiful chaos of our synthesis was ultimately distilled into a highly structured User Needs document, delivered in the client's preferred Excel format. This demonstrates a key part of the work: adapting our outputs to fit seamlessly into the client's internal processes.</p>

<p>The project culminated in a strategy workshop in the US, where I presented our findings and collaborated on the prioritised user needs list to craft different opportunity areas and strategise on the different avenues the team can explore moving forward. It is a humbling and powerful moment to be in a room of decision-makers, sharing insights that people have trusted you with and bringing their voice true. My role here was to be the bridge and a thought partner — to bring the voice of the user directly to those who need to hear it most, as we build the empathy and strategic clarity that is the foundation of all great innovation.</p>
