        <h1>Coders Adaptation</h1>
    </header>

    <p><img class="image fit" src="images/fulls/laptop-codes.jpg"></p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Researching processes of knowledge sharing and practices of adaptations among volunteer coders at ‘The Public Knowledge Workshop’. A non-profit organisation dedicated to information accessibility and government transparency.</p>
<p>Their model is based on volunteers (mainly programmers) who aimed to employ their knowledge to hack their way, for their vision of a better society.</p>
<p>Conducted in 2013 for my BA in Sociology and Anthropology for the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
This work had taken place as part of a course at Professor Amalia Oliver's class “entrepreneur innovation and networks”.</p>
<h1>The problem</h1>
<p>‘The Public Knowledge Workshop’ challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>New volunteers every week in a wide range of coding skill (usually having very little to non-past experience collaborating on code-based projects.)</li>
<li>A large number of drop-outs (creating a challenge for experienced volunteers. Either devoting time and energy to help and adopt newcomers or aiming to get progress on the project with the current team or get progress individually as the most experienced and capable coders as project leaders?)</li>
<li>fluid organisational structure.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>Over a period of six months, I combined four methods of data collection:</p>
<ol>
<li>Field-site ethnography in a variety of locations where the volunteers worked and gathered, such as the Google campus on their Tel-Aviv branch.</li>
<li>Semi-structured interviews with nine volunteers ranging in gender, rank and region.</li>
<li>Text Analysis. I analysed official documents published on the organisation's website, particularly around volunteer adoption protocols.</li>
<li>Statistical Analysis. I extrapolated from GitHub all volunteers’ code sharing and statistically analysed the patterns of adoption and drop-out of new volunteers.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>The most pronounced struggles this organisation suffered from is the volunteer's integration due to the overwhelming dropouts rate they had to phase.
To unfold such patters I sought to visualise this pattern.</p>
<p>I analysed for projects which considered to be the flag projects of this organisation. Using Gaussian Mixture Model on the amounts of commits to GitHub each signed volunteer had made to their respective projects.</p>

<p>In these graphs, one can see three categories of contributors.
First, in Red - who offered a low number of commits on a short amount of days ( ranged from 0-6 days),
Second, in Green - who added a notable amount of code spread on a whole activity year (around 200-250 days).
Lastly, in Blue - Whom committed the most substantial amount of code on a long-lasting period.</p>
<p>All present a similar pattern,
1. where more than 50% of contributors, are in the red group. Indeed demonstrating how new volunteers come in, try to add their value, and drop out after one meeting.
2. How the Green group, the established members, who add a significant amount of code and yet do not seem to carry on further with the project and drop off after an arguably short amount of time.</p>
<h1>Findings</h1>
<p>My research shed light on these two main areas:
1. There is an underline cause for dropping out volunteers, as ‘The Public Knowledge Workshop’ is a known place to be recruited by tech companies looking for juniors roles with coding skills. Which could explain the pattern of the green group.<br>
1. The fluid managing structure is not suitable for such an organisation. Where the most tech-savvy, the blue group, the most valuable coders being otherwise engaged in non-technical tasks such as welcoming the newcomers and explaining the organisation's framework.</p>
<h1>Suggested Solutions</h1>
<ol>
<li>Aim for non-technical personas to enter as volunteers as coordinates and project managers.</li>
<li>Invest in a learning source for newcomers.</li>
<li>Create a work repository, level-based, task managers. Where project leader could share tasked based on technical skills.</li>
<li>Aim for a meeting on regular bases to discuss the project and future goals.</li>
</ol>
<p>The work was very well received, and I graduated with distinction.</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Using my data collection, analysis and findings I was able to uncover new volunteers struggles and the impediments in the knowledge-sharing practices that were leading to an astonishing amount of dropouts,  leading to inevitable exhaustion of personal and resources.
By helping the organisation improve their volunteer's adaptation practices, I created a valuable impact not only on the organisation goals rather on potential healthier user-government interaction.</p>
