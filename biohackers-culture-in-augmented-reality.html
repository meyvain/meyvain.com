        <h1>Biohackers Culture in Augmented Reality</h1>
    </header>

    <p><img class="image fit" src="images/fulls/under_your_skin_app_look.png"></p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Conducted in 2019 as part of my MSc in Digital Anthropology at UCL .
In this final year research project I was assigned to research a sub-culture group in London.
I chose to research the Biohackers community. Particularly, Biohacking subculture, involving RFID/NFC chip installation into the human body.</p>
<p><strong>Project timeline</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>project's plan: 2 weeks</li>
<li>research: 1 month</li>
<li>analysis: 1 week</li>
<li>prototype: 1 week</li>
<li>presentation day</li>
</ul>
<p>Questioning how emerging technologies, such as those of microchips and contact-less infrastructure etc, create new opportunities to reframe the embodied experience of being human, challenging the limits and abilities of the human body, while experimenting with what 'being human' might look like in the future.</p>

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<ul>
<li>Allocating participants</li>
<li>Creating an engaging form of demonstrating ethnographic data in an interactive way, without losing the complexity and context of the social phenomena.</li>
<li>Time and resources constraints</li>
<li>No experience in building a website or an AR app.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>I decided to combine three methods to establish adequately varied data to work with. Therefore, I performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Field work ethnography on site (in a body art studio in south London where they offer chips injection to biohacker clientele)</li>
<li>Online ethnography (both in social media and specialised forums on Biohacking)</li>
<li>Interviews (with 7 users, both in person and virtually)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Findings</h1>
<ol>
<li>Being a biohacker is about an act of connecting the human body with technology.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"A lot of the people I know that done that are just for the sake of having one,
they find it exciting, they considered themselves cyborgs", C, Biohacker, London.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>being a pioneer, creating novel ways to interact and augment the body with technology,</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"Augmentation ought to be seen less as a solution than as a tool [vocal emphasis]
you can use to build yourself in new directions.",  I, Biohacker, London.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This practice emerged and still routed in DIY practices, Biohacking for many is part of being in a community and even part of the identity for some, who share and create together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's a way of taking control.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's your hidden extension.
You wouldn't know if I won't be interested for you to know", I, Biohacker, London.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A way to imagine the future in an pro-active way.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Deliverables</h1>
<p>To unpack my research findings I chose to incorporate both fiction and reality based on the research findings.</p>
<p>Therefore, on one hand, I decided to simulate a fictional body art studio's online shop, where I aimed to keep the 'first-person perspective' of the user, as a potential client. And on the other hand, presenting faithfully real input from my research findings.</p>
<h2>I. Website</h2>
<p>The Under your Skin project's <a href="https://meyvain.wixsite.com/underyourskin">website</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xh1R7xtPp8">YouTube video</a> were created to demonstrate the experience from the viewpoint of a Biohacker customer, i.e the user, browsing through the catalogue and the AR app.</p>

  <figcaption> Snapshot from a YouTube video I'd put together for the Under your Skin project demonstrating the experience from the viewpoint of a Biohacker customer, i.e the user, browsing through the catalogue and using the AR app I made.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This website and AR app were designed to offer a way to browse through optional body augmentation options (including injecting the microchip) and thought-provoking scenarios to interact with possible futures.</p>
<h3>Designed to help the user consider:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Where to put the microchip,</li>
<li>What are the advantages / disadvantages upon such choices (e.g with putting a chip under your arm with your Bitcoin wallet you probably are safe from potential casual theft but it will be very uncomfortable to use on a daily bases)</li>
<li>What sort of potential modifications one can do now, or in the future (e.g putting a game microchip next to one's eyes without anyone knowing they are playing.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>II. Augmented Reality (AR) app prototype</h2>
<p>I composed the website and the augmented reality (AR) app to be connected as a holistic experience for a conceptual new user that is looking to get "chipped in" and join the Biohacking community.</p>

</div>

<h3>Why AR?</h3>
<p>In all the interviews for this project, the curiosity about future technology and its impact on the human body was profoundly present. Incorporating AR was a matter of looking for a creative and imaginative solution to a question of how to present my interviewee's answers regarding a future that does not yet exist.</p>
<p>For instance, I wanted to explore their view on the future of their practice, and what they would like their biohacking abilities to be able to conjure if their wildest dreams were possible.</p>
<p>This led me to create a conceptual prototype that could combine the existing human body, future imaginative impact, and an ongoing trend in retail of incorporating AR in many online cutting-edge customer experiences.</p>

<h1>Lesson Learned</h1>
<h2>Don't run straight to prototyping</h2>
<p>I certainly needed to spend more effort to design this whole project. I was very exited with the findings from the research (that went so well!) that I ran to the prototyping of the website and
  AR app (which I learn to do from scratch) with very little effort on the design plan process.
For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>I skipped the wire-frame stage for the website - big mistake. huge. it didn't work Where I ended up with a very messy website with crude navigation that isn't clear.</li>
<li>No testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the time limitation I had. I shouldn't have skipped the testing part. Either the spelling mistakes (arrrr the shame!) or the fact there where so many usability issues. So much so that even the YouTube video I made to explain the whole project, to make it clear and visual, came out very confusing as well. Yes, the irony.</p>
<h2>Clear story is key</h2>
<p>I jumped between the user perspective and the "narrator researcher" perspective. Creating a very confusing story to follow.
The story of those Biohackers was good, fascinating in fact, but I didn't told it right and so couldn't communicate it as it ought to have been.</p>
<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>I defensively went a bit overboard with this one. Too many angles resulting in an uncomprehended project. I had to explain a great deal to reach understanding in the presentation day and anyone I showed my website to ever since.</p>
