## The Challenge

A client tasked us to build foundational knowledge of different methods of drug delivery to determine proceduralists' needs associated to various Intratumoral Drug Delivery (ITDD)
approaches and identify future treatment pathways for new lung drug delivery.


## The Approach

We had conducted multi-geography on-site ethnography (we’ve been in China, US, France and Germany) in various operating theatres and conducted numerous In-Depth Interviews with interventionalists and specialists as we embedded ourselves in the field.

In the process, we identify quite a lot of needs and opportunities – and so we involved Key Opinion Leaders from the industry to help our clients to prioritise those needs through alignment workshops to drive the next phase of innovation with much better clarity and strategic alignment.


## Deliverables

A detailed workflow map (following the bioDesign framework), annotated procedure videos taken during fieldwork, observation summaries, a challenge heat map, an interview summary report, an insights report (highlighting pain points and narrative) as well as the summary of the needs prioritisation workshop we conducted with the client and a panel of KOL (key opinion leaders).

## The Pneumothorax Paradox

The narrative we heard from our client again and again was that a key procedure in the few we were tasked to evaluate was considered too complex and risky, making it a low strategic fit for them, primarily due to the potential for pneumothorax, or a collapsed lung, (pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall a common risk during lung biopsy) even though this approach had immense market and scalability potential.

But what does this **risk** actually look like in practice? To move beyond secondhand reports and our client's assumptions and truly understand the context, we agreed we ought to be in the room. This is, I would argue, the power of ethnography: witnessing the unmet needs, appreciating the nuances, exposing the unrealised pain points that other methods alone cannot capture.

Observing these procedures in the operating theatre, I argue, provided us with a much richer understanding of the clinicians' workflow and enabled us to witness the needs that are often left unsaid and in turn, become unmet opportunities. Particularly, as we felt that understanding the gravitas of the pneumothorax risk and contextualising it against our client's assumptions was key.

So off we went, my key goals were to explore the workflow, examine the procedure and play special attention to the proceduralist's dynamic and document it in a way that would, if anything, help our clients build empathy with these proceduralists and better understand their experience; seeing and feeling the nuances of their stress, excitement and decision making.

And there I was, in an imaging suite in France, standing behind the interventionalists' shoulders as they assessed a patient post-biopsy. A moment of excitement was cut short. Without a word, a radiologist replayed the CT scan. Silence. A tensed smile. Pneumothorax was found.

What I witnessed wasn't just a clinical event; it was a complex, high-stakes decision-making moment. The team had to instantly decide whether to aspirate the lung, keep the patient overnight, or perform another scan. The client's perceived "high risk" was, in reality, a cascade of critical judgments made under pressure, yet indeed, it was not what the client had predominantly assumed, anticipated and based their business model upon.

Observation also made another, more critical challenge visually undeniable: the lack of real-time navigation.

The images above were taken during field observation I performed in France and Germany on the same type of procedure, but on another organ. Note how the injected contrasting agent spreads in the lung (left) vs. the liver ( right). See how the lung anatomy imposes a significant challenge in isolating the vasculature that proceduralists need in order to confirm and navigate towards the feeding vessel to complete the procedure successfully.

Using Mural functions to co-create when hosting a strategy workshop online with our clients, allowed us to collaborate and align instantly. Participants where able to vote and prioritise identified user needs and opportunity areas, as well as highlighting potential risks and barriers and clarify and highlight where our team needed more direction in an interactive manner.

## Strategic Impact & Long-Term Partnership

This deep, ethnographic approach built significant trust and delivered strategic clarity. The success of this foundational discovery project led to a long-term partnership, with the client commissioning over six subsequent projects with our team.

I am particularly proud that the client, recognising the value of this human-centred approach, specifically approached me to help commission one of the above-mentioned projects, a discovery research project on an adjacent therapeutic area, continuing our work of grounding their innovation strategy in unmet needs and building strong relationships to foster great partnerships.
