<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Tasked with helping a visionary but unfocused design startup define its place in the market, I co-led an exploratory research initiative to ground their abstract concepts in human-centered insights. We delivered a research framework and a set of strategic tools that helped the founders clarify their value proposition, prioritize opportunity areas, and create a repeatable ideation process for future projects.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As part of a university-led consultancy project, our team was paired with Our Own Skin, a conceptual design startup exploring "new materiality"â€”biomaterials and advanced wearables. They had a wealth of visionary ideas but needed a structured, human-centered approach to identify tangible market opportunities and understand the potential for cultural adoption.</p>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>The core challenge was to translate the founders' abstract vision into a focused business strategy. We needed to move from a broad exploration of "human augmentation" to identifying specific, unmet user needs where their unique design approach could provide real value.</p>
<h2>My Contribution &amp; Methods</h2>
<p>Our approach was to ground their abstract concepts in the reality of human experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Framework Development: We first collaborated with the client to create a research framework, focusing on three key lenses for exploring the body: Performance (Sports), Function (Health &amp; Wellness), and Adornment (Fashion).</li>
<li>Ethnographic Research: I then led the "Function" workstream, conducting ethnographic research with users in the health and wellness space. This process was designed to uncover latent needs and cultural perceptions related to the body, well-being, and technology adoption.</li>
<li>Strategic Synthesis &amp; Tool Creation: The insights from all three workstreams were then synthesized and translated into tangible, strategic tools to provide lasting value for the client.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<p>Instead of a traditional report, we created a suite of tools to empower the startup's ongoing work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Strategic Clarity Workshop: We designed and facilitated a workshop that guided the founders through our research insights, using affinity mapping and prioritization exercises to help them define a clearer narrative for their brand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Repeatable Ideation Tool (The Design Game): We created a custom adaptation of "The Thing From the Future," a design game that provided a structured process for their own conceptual design work and for use in future client workshops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Foundational Insight Database: We delivered a curated database of our ethnographic findings, providing the initial, user-centered data to fuel their future design concepts and ground their work in real human needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
