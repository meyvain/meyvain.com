<h1>Background</h1>
<p>This project was conducted in 2019 as part of an internship for a materials design startup and consultancy, part of Design Anthropology module, in University College London.</p>
<p>As a team of three students, we were paired with the London based firm <a href="https://ourownskin.co.uk/">Our Own Skin</a>. They are visionary conceptual designers who were at the time in the process of developing their brand in the field. They were working on their conceptual designs while figuring out their business strategy and goals.</p>
<p>Our Own Skin were interested in "new" materiality. These are either products made from the body, otherwise known as bio or grown materials, or new forms of wearable technology.
We were tasked with helping the firm get a better understanding of trends around body augmentation in the industry, as well as exploring possible cultural adoptions of "new" materiality designs.
We conducted exploratory research, focusing on the body and human augmentation. Delivering design workshop, a design game as a tool for prospective projects and initial database.</p>
<h1>Challenges</h1>
<ul>
<li>Improve clarity and help focus the designers' wide range of interests and projects.</li>
<li>Our Own Skin were looking to overcome the limited availability of human grown materials and find ways to incorporate biomaterials in their designs. However, innovative biomaterials or "new" materiality is a relatively new and undeveloped field, where human extracted materials (i.e. human bi-products turned into materials) or grown materials are not widely used.</li>
<li>time constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>We had to create a unique value proposition for Our Own Skin, and to further help them build their brand and a clear narrative to land successfully as a niche player in the design consulting market. Our project’s approach to this focused on the human body, for which we created an initial database for further growth and clarity workshop.</p>
<p>To address these objectives, we proposed to begin by gaining an understanding of people’s perceptions around the body, and the relationship of the body with materials in different sectors and professions.</p>
<p>The focal point of the research was to collaborate with people within selected communities to gain a holistic understanding of how they understood their bodies. Based on an empathetic understanding of people’s relationships with their bodies, we will be able to develop target spaces and insights that will help develop an authentic positioning for the client to grow.</p>
<p>Together with the clients, we established 3 target areas for exploration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sports (performance)</li>
<li>Health &amp; Wellness (function)</li>
<li>Fashion (adornment)</li>
</ol>
<p>From each category, we had found a representative, who we later conducted an ethnographic session with, gathering our core database.</p>
<p><strong>My Contribution</strong></p>
<p>We divided the research work equally, where each got one sector to be researched. I was in charge of Health &amp; Wellness.</p>
<h1>Deliverables</h1>
<p>To create conceptual designs around "new" bodily made materials, wearable technology and human augmentation as well as body conceptual designs, we gathered ethnographic data to workshop together with our clients.</p>
<p>Creating:
1. A conceptual ideas generator workshop.
2. A game for innovating designs to be used for consultancy or in house projects.
3. Passing along the database for initial work on new concepts and a foundation to grow from.</p>
<h2>I. Workshop</h2>
<ol>
<li>Show study cases and analysis</li>
<li>Priority pyramid exercise</li>
<li>Affinity diagramming of results</li>
<li>Clarity generator exercise (unfolding the clutter)</li>
</ol>

<h2>II. Game: Design From the Future.</h2>
<p>Our own original adaptation of the popular design game, <a href="http://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/">"The Thing From the Future”</a>. The Design From the Future game was made to function either as part of the creative process of coming up with new designs and conceptual areas for exploration or integrated as part of the client’s own workshops they run as a consultancy.</p>

<p>The Design game combines the client's needs, prospective areas of exploration and designs constraints. For instance, a workshop could be attended on how to combine different body parts to be designed for with a specific material in question.</p>
<h2>III. Analysis</h2>
<p>Datasets and sheet analysis for the clients to work with initial insights on possible cultural adoption of "new" materiality designs and body perspectives based on our research.</p>
