<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This case study explores the nuanced user experience of surgeons operating with the da Vinci robotic system (by Intuitive Inc). Through deep ethnographic research in the operating theatre, I uncovered a core tension in the human-robot interaction—a conflict between the robot, as a seamless extension of the surgeon's body, and its reality as an external tool. This insight, arguably, reveals that the system's rapid adoption might be driven as much by its profound, immersive user experience as by its clinical outcomes, highlighting the critical role of human-centred design in the success of high-stakes medical technology.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In high-stakes environments like surgery, design is not a luxury; it dictates workflow, influences performance, and can transform an entire field. This project, conducted for my MSc in Digital Anthropology at UCL, was a deep dive into one of the most transformative technologies in modern medicine. My goal was to move beyond the technical specifications and understand the human reality of performing surgery through a robotic interface.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finding participants - surgeons are notoriously amongst the busiest people to track down.</li>
<li>Negotiating time constraints.</li>
<li>Limited resources - getting un-balanced data due to small sample size and lack of resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>To understand the authentic user experience, I conducted generative, ethnographic research inside a specialised robotic-assisted surgery department. My approach included: 
- Contextual Inquiry: six multi-hour surgeries in the operating theatre, capturing the unfiltered realities of the workflow, team dynamics, and human-robot interaction.
- In-Depth Interviews: six Semi-structured interviews with surgeons to explore their perceptions, motivations, and the nuances of their experience with the system.
- On-Site Intercepts: Informal interviews with surgical staff to build a holistic ecosystem view of how the technology impacts the entire team.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>I used Thematic Analysis to code the observational and interview data, identifying recurring patterns in behaviour and language. These patterns were then clustered using Affinity Diagrams to map the core components of the surgeon's experience, which revealed a consistent and profound psychological tension at the heart of the interaction.</p>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>The most critical finding was the discovery of a latent, unarticulated tension in how surgeons experience the robot. On one hand, they described an almost total sensory immersion—a feeling of becoming one with the machine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The experience is so immersive that you feel like one becomes the machine... your hands are the robot's hands.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was often framed as the robot being a seamless extension of their own body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I mean, it just feels like an extension of you... that sense of me being part of you, you know?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, every surgeon simultaneously framed the robot as just another instrument, creating a psychological conflict between 'being' the robot and merely 'using' the robot. This tension is the core of their user experience—navigating a tool that feels both like a part of them and completely separate at the same time.</p>
<h2>Other Insights</h2>
<p>The strategic insight from this research is that superior user experience can be a primary driver of technology adoption, even in the absence of definitively superior clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>The actual surgical tools on the robot's arms are not radically different from those used in traditional laparoscopic surgery. What is radically different is the interface—the immersive console that creates a more ergonomic, intuitive, and less physically taxing experience for the surgeon.</p>
<p>While the medical community debates clinical efficacy, the market has delivered a clear verdict: the da Vinci system's adoption is growing exponentially. This case study demonstrates perhaps that by solving a latent, human-centred need of surgeons, the design of the user experience itself became a critical factor in transforming a multi-billion dollar industry and redefining the very practice of surgery.</p>
