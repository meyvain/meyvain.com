            <h3>Design Researcher & Strategist</h3>
        </header>

        <p>Hello I'm Mitch :) I'm a Design Researcher dedicated to uncovering unmet user needs in healthcare, pharma and medtech, and my work begins where the real world can't be simulated. My preferred habitat is the corner of an operating theatre, translating deep ethnographic insights into strategic innovation.</p>

        <p>As a Human-Centred Design Researcher (HCD), I work to bring the unfiltered reality of the user's experience to the forefront of every strategic decision, bridging the gap between the clinical floor and the development team.</p>

        <p>I'm an audiobook listener, escape room enthusiast and a mother of identical twins who are the least alike you'll ever meet.</p>
